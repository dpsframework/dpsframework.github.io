# Acknowledgments


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Website, and of course the DPS-Agent Library with
capacity for Distributed Problem Solving using Expert Systems, 
operating autonomously in each agent and, which have
embedded in the DPS-Agents, they would not have been possible without the
profound generosity of senior technologists and researchers dedicated to continuous
exploration and development of programming environments and the creation of Project-Management environments.
 To all of them, my sincere and perpetual admiration.
Frameworks like Jekyll, Platforms like GitHub, Interpreters so dear
like BeanShell for Java, Java's own openJDK compiler, the great platform
JADE agent development, the SWING RSyntaxTextArea magic component,
or the kind HSQL Database Manager for Java, and many others that, I don't want to forget,
such as the Apache-Ant builder or the Apache-Jena Web-Semantic analysis library.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave the best for last: the long-awaited dream team that I enjoyed during the period 2012-2017, they all attached to the _Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering and Automation_ from the University of León. I will try not to forget any of them here. Well, it has been more than two years and I hope that memory does not play tricks on me. They are; María del **Carmen** Benavides Cuéllar, **Héctor** Alaiz Moretón and, **Isaías** García Rodríguez. To whom should I add: **Angel** Alonso Álvarez, **Francisco Jesús** Rodríguez Sedano, **José Manuel** Alija Pérez. And somewhat further from León, but no less influential in this project: **José Luis** Calvo-Rolle (University of A Coruña), **Emilio** S. Corchado Rodríguez (University of Salamanca) and, **Paulo** Jorge Novais (University of Minho (Portugal)).
